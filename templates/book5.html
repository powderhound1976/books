<h2>Agent Sonya: Moscow's Most Daring Wartime Spy</h2>
<p>by Ben Macintyre</p>
<p>The true story behind the Cold War’s most intrepid female spy.</p>
<p>
  In 1942, in a quiet village in the leafy English Cotswolds, a thin, elegant
  woman lived in a small cottage with her three children and her husband, who
  worked as a machinist nearby. Ursula Burton was friendly but reserved, and
  spoke English with a slight foreign accent. By all accounts, she seemed to be
  living a simple, unassuming life. Her neighbors in the village knew little
  about her.

<p>
  They didn’t know that she was a high-ranking Soviet intelligence officer. They
  didn’t know that her husband was also a spy, or that she was running powerful
  agents across Europe. Behind the facade of her picturesque life, Burton was a
  dedicated Communist, a Soviet colonel, and a veteran agent, gathering the
  scientific secrets that would enable the Soviet Union to build the bomb.

  This true-life spy story is about the woman code-named “Sonya.” Over the
  course of her career, she was hunted by the Chinese, the Japanese, the Nazis,
  MI5, MI6, and the FBI—and she evaded them all. Her story reflects the great
  ideological clash of the twentieth century—between Communism, Fascism, and
  Western democracy—and casts new light on the spy battles and shifting
  allegiances of our own times.

<p>
  With unparalleled access to Sonya’s diaries and correspondence and
  never-before-seen information on her clandestine activities, Ben Macintyre has
  written a history of a legendary secret agent, a woman who influenced the
  course of the Cold War and helped plunge the world into a decades-long
  standoff between nuclear superpowers. (less)
